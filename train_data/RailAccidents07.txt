At approx.","3:00 p.m. that same day, P&L crew picked up the train which became train WW227. with three UP locomo","tives and 101 loaded coal cars, and derailed 9 loads of coal while leaving  track Zip 1 at Paducah.","As a result of the derailment, 1578 feet of track was destroyed as well as extensive damage to Isla","nd Creek Bridge.  

Investigation revealed that the first point of derailment occurred 1578 feet i","n advance of the Island Creek Bridge.  Analysis of the event recorder data revealed that two emergen","cy brake applications occurred.  The first occurred 1350 feet in advance of the bridge.  This indica","tes that the car derailed 228 feet prior to the first emergency application.  The second emergency a","pplication occurred at the bridge.  The UP crew was in possession of the train when the first emerge","ncy application occurred and when brakes released, pulled the train forward approximately 190 feet t","o the point of final stop.

Data from the derailment site, as well as event recorder and other inf","ormation, was analyzed. Although a definitive cause for this derailment has not been established, ba","sed on analysis by P&L personnel as well as Rail Sciences, Inc. of Scottsdale, GA, there is no doubt","that the initial derailment occurred while the train was in the possession of the UP crew and that","when the P&L crew took possession and began leaving, the major damage occurred.
